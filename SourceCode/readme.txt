If you want to change or compile the code, you have to adapt the USB-Type within Teensyduino.
You can do this by our own by replace the files in this folder within Teensduino.
But please backup the original files first before replacing it.
This replacement is made for Teensyduino v1.8.19.
It will not work for Arduino v2.x
